# 🧠 Personality Prediction System

A Machine Learning–based personality prediction web app that classifies users as **Introvert, Ambivert, or Extrovert** based on questionnaire responses.

## 🚀 Features
- ML model trained on personality-related traits
- Predicts a **continuous social score** instead of direct class labels
- Converts social score into Introvert / Ambivert / Extrovert using logical thresholds
- Interactive questionnaire-style UI
- Streamlit-based web application
- Clean separation of **model logic** and **UI logic**
- End-to-end workflow: data processing → model training → prediction → deployment

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn** (model training, pipelines, scaling)
- **Pandas** (data handling and preprocessing)
- **Streamlit** (web interface and deployment)
- **StandardScaler** (feature normalization)
- **Linear Regression** (social score prediction)
- **HTML/CSS (via Streamlit markdown)** for UI customization

## 📌 Project Highlights
- Demonstrates the difference between **regression and classification**
- Handles ambiguity in personality traits using a score-based approach
- Focuses on real-world ML concepts like feature engineering and model deployment
- Designed for learning, experimentation, and portfolio demonstration
